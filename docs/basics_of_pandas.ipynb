    "# Python Programming Language for Data Analysis with Pandas Library\n",

    "**In this workshop we will analyze the data set with information on return and Morningstar Sustainalytics rating of 2000+ ETF from 2015 to 2021 using the `pandas` library.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Python programming language has numerous functions. These functions are organized into modules. Modules are python scripts that contain Python objects. In order to use the objects inside these modules (or commonly known as libraries), we must first import either the entire module or specific objects in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`pandas` (Python for Data Analysis)** is a popular python library for data analysis. We will use this library extensively in this workshop. This library is automatically installed during Anaconda installation. It is also installed and available on Google Colab or UofT Jupyter Hub. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other popular python libraries are **`NumPy` (Numerical Python)** and **`matplotlib`** used for scientific computing and visualization, respectively. We will use these libraries too. "

    "1. Read the entire data from a csv file or read select columns only\n",

    "Let's take a moment to understand the three lines of code above. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the keyword `import` is available directly in Python and is used to find and load the objects of a Python module into the Python environment we are working in. The `import` keyword is followed by the module name we are looking to import. So, here we have imported the `pandas`, the `numpy` and the `matplotlib` libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Often instead of importing the libraries with its original name, we import them with an alias using the `as` keyword. This is useful because everytime we want to use a function inside the library, instead of typing the full name of the module, we can just type the short alias. So `pd` for `pandas` and `np` for numpy and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the last line of import is slightly different as it contains a `.`, which is called the **dot operator**:\n",
    "1. The dot operator is used to access items that are inside of the object. Simply type the name of the object and then `.` followed by the item to access. \n",
    "2. Sometimes the Python libraries are so big that they need to be managed inside multiple sub-modules. Each sub-module of a module can be accessed by using the `.`. In this example, `pyplot` sub-module is imported instead of the entire `matplotlib` module. Then, the alias `plt` is given to this sub-module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we will make use of the dot operator like this to access the objects available in a module. Let's begin by using the `.` to access the function `read_csv` available in the pandas library. It allows us to read a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'> A **function** in python is a block of code that has been attached to a name. So `read_csv`, underneath its name, is a whole bunch of codes that run to ensure the file we want to read is imported into the python environment. We do not need to see these codes but we do need to look at the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) of the function so that we can understand how to use it. For example, we need to know which parameters the function takes and provide value for at least those parameters that are mandatory. </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the documentation, the first parameter of `read_csv` is the `filepath_or_buffer`. It is a mandatory parameter and takes as value the path to the file you want to load, including the file name. The parameters and their corresponding values are inserted inside the parenthesis, `( )` which must be placed right next to the function without any spaces."
